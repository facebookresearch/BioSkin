## Installation

### Download
`git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/BioSkin.git`

### Requirements

`python -m venv ./venv` \
`.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` \
`python -m pip install --upgrade pip` \
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Packaging

Simply run `python -m pip install .` and the package should be available by `import bioskin`.

## Running
To have an overview of the different use cases and practical applications, check _examples.py_.
Run selecting the application with --mode. e.g.: --mode "Reconstruction".
* _GUI_: Interactive estimation and editing tool. See next section.
* _Reconstruction_: Estimates skin properties from diffuse albedo textures.
* _Sampler_:  Skin tones sampler.
* _Augment_:  Augment dataset with skin properties.
* _OptimizeCCM_:  Optimize color correction matrix given an image or a set of images (with consistent illumination).
* _Homogenize_:  Match skin properties and reflectance to a target (all textures to the last one loaded).
* _OptimizeProps_:  Optimize bio maps using the decoder only (skin properties --> reflectance spectra).

For training new models, RGB or spectral of different wavelength ranges, different losses, etc. please check 
_bioskin/train.py_ or _bioskin/train_exposure_aware.py_.

### GUI/Demo
* The GUI displays the first character from the input folder. Switch using '_Character_' menu.
* The main window can be interacted with like general maps (zooming, moving, etc).
* Clicking on the component images (and small reflectance) on the right switches the main view to that specific texture 
for more details.
* Use '_View_' menu to switch from visible range reflectance, to near infrared reflectance, original and edited (key `e` 
toggles the original and the edited versions). 
* Edits are stacked one after another. Once you are done, press '_Push Edits and Update Reflectance_' to see the effect 
on the albedo. Also use:
  * '_Reset Reflectance_' button to recover the original skin reflectance and all unedited property maps.
  * '_Reset Property_' button to undo and recover the original skin property map.
  * '_Load from File_' button to perform edits outside the program. Edit any map (the .jpeg) in the 
_output_folder_ and press the '_Load from File_' button.
